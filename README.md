This fork was created to make specific changes that we wanted because of [Document Manager 2.0](https://github.com/Unbabel/document-manager).

For more information on Matecat Filters check the [original repo](https://github.com/matecat/MateCat-Filters).
To run Filters follow [this wiki](https://github.com/matecat/MateCat-Filters/wiki/Build-and-run).

**Important None:** At the time I'm writing this (26/10/2016) it is written in the wiki that you should run:

`java -cp ".:filters-1.2.1.jar" com.matecat.converter.Main`

With the Unbabel version you should run:

`java -cp ".:filters-1.2.2.jar" com.matecat.converter.Main`

Anyway, just be sure to run this command with correct version.
